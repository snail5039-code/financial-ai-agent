    The four orders' facts (company, price, quantity, ...) always come fresh
    from `build_approval_orders()` — this class only persists the one thing
    that changes: which decision_id was approved/rejected, and when. That's
    also why a restart doesn't need to re-seed anything: any decision_id with
    no row in `approval_decisions` is still "pending" by construction.

    `db_path=":memory:"` (the default, and what every test's bare
    `create_app()` gets) keeps each store fully isolated and non-persistent —
    exactly the old in-memory dict's behavior. `app/main.py` passes a real
    file path so a restart of the actual app keeps approval history.
